LeetCode #1644 - LCA BT II - Facebook & Microsoft & Amazon & LinkedIn

Given the root of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes, p and q.
If either node p or q does not exist in the tree, return null. All values of the nodes in the tree are unique.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Things to be aware about the find LCA II:

1.  Two target nodes is not guaranteed to exist in the tree
2.  A node is considered as descendant of itself.
So remember that:

we cannot instantly return the node we found here because we don't know if all m and n exist in the tree!
'''
# Approach 1 
'''
Basically the exact same solution as LC 236-Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree, except we need to keep track of whether both p and q exist in the tree. If both of them are, return node. Otherwise, return null.

Time Complexity:
O(n), n = number of nodes in the tree

Typical DFS algorithms has O(V+E) time complexity, where V stands for vertices and E stands for edges. According to the definition of tree, we have N-1 number of edges. Therefore the time complexity resolves to O(N+N-1) = O(2N-1) ~ O(N)
Space Complexity
O(n) -- recursion stack space + return values

# Approach 2 - Breadth First Search
'''
The idea is simmilar with 1257, first visit all the nodes and record their parents, then use a set to store all the parents of one node and traverse the next node's ancestors to find the first parent in the set.

Depth First Search
The idea is simmilar with 236. First call l, r to finish the traversal of a tree and used self.countpï¼Œ self.countq to check the two target nodes exsit in the tree.
