LeetCode #973

The Euclidean distance of a point P(x,y) from the origin can be calculated through the following formula:

âˆš{x^2 + y^2}

This problem follows the Top K Numbers pattern. 
The only difference in this problem is that we need to find the closest point (to the origin) as compared to finding the largest numbers.

We can use a Max Heap to find K points closest to the origin.

While iterating through all points, IF a point (say P) is closer to the origin than the TOP POINT of the max-heap

we will remove that top point from the heap and add P to always keep the closest points in the heap.
