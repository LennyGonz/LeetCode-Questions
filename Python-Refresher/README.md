# Python

Python is a general-purpose language meaning that it can be used for a variety of applications and does not focus on any one aspect of programming

It falls under the category of **high-level, interpreted** languages.

A high-level language is one which **cannot be understood directly by our machine**. Machines are generally designed to read machine code, but high-level syntax cannot be directly converted to machine code

It must first be converted to **bytecode**, which is then converted to machine code before the program can be executed

Python is an **interpreted** language because, during execution, each line is interpreted to the machine language on-the-go.
As opposed to languages like C++, the code needs to be compiled into an executable first, and then it can be executed.
In python, we can skip this compilation step (Python does it behind the scenes) and directly runs the code
