# Problems Encountered in the Wild

You are given an array of integers `numbers`. Your task is to count the number of distinct pairs `(i,j)` such that `0 <= i < j < numbers.length`, `numbers[i]`, and `numbers[j]` have the same number of digits, and only one of the digits differ between `numbers[i]` and `numbers[j]`
